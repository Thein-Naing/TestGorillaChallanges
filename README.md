# TestGorillaChallanges Experience
`In my honest opinion, you need to prepare very well for this kind of test.`


1.There are 5 different sections for 50 minutes time interval for my case.

2. Practice questions (as seen in my screen)

Youâ€™ll receive 4 practice questions related to the test you are about to take, with 5 minutes to answer them.
Practice questions provide an opportunity to see both the sort of questions asked and the platform layout. 
Your answers to these questions do not contribute to your final score , nor does the employer see your answers to them.
Tip: Practice questions are at the start of every test and include a gold call-out to prevent confusion.

3.Most tests consist of three question types:
Multiple-choice
Multiple-select
True/false (either/or)

`4.  This 5 different sessions are;`

`a. Algorithms test ( it is not easy but not so difficult also)`

`b. Basic programming skills / you don't need to code but you have to solve the given problems by means of any necessary.`

`c. SQL/MYSQL queries (e.g how many employess with salary between $1500 to S1800 e.t.c)`

`d. Data struuctures such as binary tree/linked list/stack/queue/heap/binary search tree/hashing/graph/and advanced concepts e.t.c.
(To be able to answer these type of questions, you guys must be good enough or competent in computer science but I can answer a bit only)`

`e. Technical and analytical skills test for programming and problem solving (you need to write down  with pencil on paper to illustrate answers for problems).`

5. They want your comments afetr finishing each session (how do you feel the test)and after all finished you have to submit another form for your personal informations such as degree/diploma e.t.c.
