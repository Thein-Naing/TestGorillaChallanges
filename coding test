# TestGorillaChallanges Experience
`In my honest opinion, you need to prepare very well for this kind of test. But this is software engineer intern role only.
I want to prepare for all kind of interview challenges and even though it is an intern position, I want to give it a try.

1.There are 5 different sections for 50 minutes time interval for my case.

2. Practice questions (as seen in my screen)

Youâ€™ll receive 4 practice questions related to the test you are about to take, with 5 minutes to answer them.
Practice questions provide an opportunity to see both the sort of questions asked and the platform layout. 
Your answers to these questions do not contribute to your final score , nor does the employer see your answers to them.
Tip: Practice questions are at the start of every test and include a gold call-out to prevent confusion.

3.Most tests consist of three question types:
Multiple-choice
Multiple-select
True/false (either/or)

4.  This different sessions are
a.Algorithms test
b.Basic programming skills / you don't need to code but you have to solve the given problem by means of any necessary.
c.SQL/MYSQL queries
d.Data struuctures such as binary tree/linked list/stack/queue/heap/binary search tree/hashing/graph/and advanced concepts e.t.c.
(To be able to answer these type of questions, you must good enough in computer science but I can answer a bit only)
e.Technical and analytical skills test for programming and problem solving (you need to write down  with pencil on paper to illustrate answers for problems)`
